# CSS Pricing Cards

Welcome to the CSS Pricing Cards project! This project showcases a set of beautifully designed responsive pricing cards, implemented with HTML and CSS. It features three distinct pricing plans: **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium**. Each card highlights unique features and pricing, optimized for a sleek, modern look that adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The pricing cards are designed to adapt fluidly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
  
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Each pricing card has an engaging hover effect that subtly lifts it and enhances the shadow, creating a dynamic, modern feel for users.

- **Stylish Pricing Sections**: Each card includes a distinctive price segment with creative design elements, showcasing a unique "price tag" and detailed plan descriptions.

- **Clear Call-to-Action**: Every plan is equipped with a prominent "GET PLAN" button, designed to drive user engagement and make selections straightforward.
