# CSS Pricing Cards

This project features a set of responsive pricing cards implemented with HTML and CSS. It displays three pricing plans: **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium**, each showcasing different features and pricing. The design is sleek, modern, and responsive, optimized to work across various screen sizes.

## Features
